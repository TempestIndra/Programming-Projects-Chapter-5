/*
* Design and implement a class called Flight that represents an

* airline name, the flight number, and the flight's origin and des-

* tialize all instance data. Include getter and setter methods for all
* instance data. Include a toString method that returns a one-line
* description of the flight.Create a driver class called FlightTest,
* whose main method instantiates and updates several Flight
